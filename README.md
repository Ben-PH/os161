# os161, now featuring Learning Projects

This repo was motivated by my aim to get maximum value out of courses oriented around Harvards os161 instructional operating system. Through the act of distilling my process of learning into a repository, organised into a published book, meshes well with my learning style, and has the added bonus of demonstrating my work.

### How to use.

* Clone the repo
* Read /Documentation/learning_project/src/foreword.md
* ???
* profit

At time of writing there is much TODO.
