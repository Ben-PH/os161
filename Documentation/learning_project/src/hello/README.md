# Project Hello

Learning OS stuff is no different to starting a new language. "hello world" is our go-to, so let's get started.

## Aims

* To be able to setup a development environment for os161
* To understand basic theory behind os build configuration
* To make basic changes to os161, and inspect these changes through gdb.

## Objectives

By the end of this project, you will have a working installation of os161 on your local machine.
#### On this installation, you will have

* A basic, but working virtualised installation of os161. 
* You have made basic modifications to this installation.
* This modification included fixing a minor bug.

While achieving this, there will be opportunities to look at other things.
* TODO: add extras >.<
