# Acquiring the project resources

Completing this section will have the content core to your project on your
system, as well as the toolchain used in os161 development. Cloning the git
repo, you can jump between branches specific to a certain learning project provided, 
with this one being on the master branch. Don't be afraid to make your own branches
if you want!

```cmd
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/Ben-PH/os161/
```

os161 development comes with some tools and utilities, but we need some more:

Download utilities .deb package [Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KSqv82TUebg2VXrtXCPjvcdlyCwQ0GA5) 
[see issue](https://github.com/Ben-PH/os161/issues/12)
install from the .deb
```cmd
$ apt install os161-utils_2.0.8.deb 
```

At this stage, there is still some manual configuration to do to get started.
We'll handle this in the next chapter.
