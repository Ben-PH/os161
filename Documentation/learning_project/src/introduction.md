# Introduction

Welcome to "os161 project notes". The big picture here, is in building the practical skills, and theoretical understandings to engineer an OS. We build this picture piece by piece, through "Learing Projects", such as kernel concurrancy programming, implimenting system calls, and building the virtual memory manager, accompanied by theory at work. 

Our primary tool for maximum fun and learning, we will be os161, an instructional OS designed and  built from the ground up for this purpose. Each step of the way, we will be tease apart the elements of this system that makes it tick, and in doing so, look behind the curtains that hide away OS workings.

### Project Aim

Through practical hands-on work

* Be comfortable navigating and working with large, complex code-bases.
* Gain profficiency in practical OS development, and its underlying theory.
* Develop Software Engineering skills that are universally applicable.

### Project Approach

This project draws heavy inspiration from the UNSW course CS3231 - Operating Systems, which in-turn is drawn from Harvards OS course. These serve as a scaffold, providing source-code, utilities and theory, with a structure from which this book extends.

Where a University course has Assignments, we have Learning Projects. Instead of grades, it is self-assesed. Without a strict course structure, you are free to explore, and go beyond, this books content
in your own way.

### Assumptions
* git installed
* gcc installed
* Ubuntu 14 (TODO: refine this so can use later/other dists)

As well as that, some useful skills include

TODO: This needs to make more sense...
* Basic git [Interactive Lessons](learngitbranching.js.org).
* Intermediate C, particularly pointers [High-Quality free course](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)
* **Basic** assembly, preferably mips.
* Linux terminal TODO: Find good resource
