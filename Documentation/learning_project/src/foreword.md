# Foreword

This book was made using mdbook. Although there is a plan to publish it like rust-book, it currently needs rust, and a crate `mdbook` in order to be browser friendly.

```text
If you wish to view everything locally, that's fine. Just brows the md files, 
starting from this directory.
```
### Instructions


* First, [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
* Now, install mdbook:
    ```cmd

    ```
* while in the rood directory of the book:
