# Foreword

This book was made using mdbook, and can be viewed in the browser as intended using mdbook, or as a regular .md documentation. [As of writing, internal links assume browser viewing](https://github.com/Ben-PH/os161/issues/2). It is distrubuted under a permissive BSD 3-Clause License[^1].

To install mdbook:

### Installing mdbook

* First, [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
* Now, install mdbook:
    ```cmd
    cargo install mdbook
    ```
* while in the root directory of the book:
  ```cmd
  mdbook serve
  ```
* Open a browser to [local-host](localhost:3000) (default port 3000)

#### One of the goals is to get this published online in the style of [rust-book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
